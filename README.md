# Qt implementation of the APress Source Code

Under fair use this repository will contain qt (currently `QWidgets`) implementation of the source code.

The QT framework has its own wrappers on calling OpenGl functions. Since that is the framework I will be working with daily, while reading the book, I practiced using QT.

Current implementation is targeted at `QWidgets`, and probably will contain draw in `QMainWindow`, 
However it is possible that I will ammend `QOpenGLWidget` and `QML` implementations as well.

The original code is currently in `Old` folder, but please refer to [original repository](https://github.com/Apress/practical-shader-dev) for the source of them. 

This repository accompanies [*Practical Shader Development*](https://www.apress.com/9781484244562) by Kyle Halladay (Apress, 2019).
