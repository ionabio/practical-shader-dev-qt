# Qt implementation of the Practical shader development book

Note. I am not affiliated with Apress or the original author of the book. 

Under fair use, this repository will contain qt (currently `QWidgets`) implementation of the source code.

The QT framework has its own wrappers for calling OpenGl functions. Since that is the framework I will be working on a daily basis, while reading the book, I practiced using QT.

The current implementation is targeted at `QWidgets`, and probably will contain `draw` in `QMainWindow`, 
However, it is possible that I will amend the `QOpenGLWidget` and `QML` implementations as well.

The original code is currently in the `Old` folder, but please refer to [original repository](https://github.com/Apress/practical-shader-dev) for the source of them. 

This repository accompanies [*Practical Shader Development*](https://www.apress.com/9781484244562) and the [original repository](https://github.com/Apress/practical-shader-dev) by Kyle Halladay (Apress, 2019).
